- Speak clearly at a moderate pace
- The confidence threshold is set to 0.3 for better recognition
- All text appears in real-time when ACTIVE - no need to wait
- Use editing commands to correct mistakes without restarting
- Say keyphrases distinctly to trigger actions
- **Deactivate when done**: Say "stop voice commander" to prevent accidental commands

## Technical Details
- **Voice activation**: Starts in SLEEPING mode, only wakes on specific keyphrases
- **Real-time typing**: Text is sent directly to terminal via xdotool
- **Keyboard simulation**: Commands send actual keyboard shortcuts
- **Voice recognition**: Uses local Whisper model (tiny by default)
- **Target window**: Captured during 5-second setup countdown
